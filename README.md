**Getting started**
* For a summary, see the presentation, 'Final feedback_02-09-2020' in this repo.
* This code follows the approach named 'PS-PC1' in the presentation, and incorporates the following tools covered in the presentation:
1. Incorporating process knowledge by validating data-based connections with a connectivity matrix.
2. Incorporating process knowledge by constraining potential root causes.
3. Tools for interpretation: Display node rankings

**Contents**
* "MAIN_Hierarchical" is the main script.
* "validate_propPath" is a function that can be called from the main script.
* "Sim_PlantModel_repIDs", "PLANTWIDE_ALL_DATA_SmallerFreqOsc_SmallerExogDist3", and "PLANTWIDE_Connectivity_matrix_FINAL" contain the simulated case study data and process knowledge.

**Requirements**
This code makes use of publicly available toolboxes and repositories:
1. [The Multivariate Granger Causality (MVGC) Toolbox](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/78727-the-multivariate-granger-causality-mvgc-toolbox)
2. [IFAC-LoopRank](https://github.com/ProcessMonitoringStellenboschUniversity/IFAC-LoopRank)
